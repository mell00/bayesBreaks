# bayesBreaks

`bayesBreaks` is an R package (see [`bayesBreaks/`](bayesBreaks/)) that implements the Bayesian Adaptive Auto-Regression (BAAR) sampler, includes packaged synthetic time-series datasets, and includes a Bai-Perron helper to compare Bayesian and frequentist breakpoint detection.

## Installation

From an R session run `devtools::install("bayesBreaks")` or `R CMD INSTALL bayesBreaks`, then load the package and run `test_data_44()` or `bai_perron_ar()` to explore the bundled examples.

## Next steps

Planned work includes drafting a vignette that walks through BAAR versus frequentist outputs, filling any remaining Rd documentation gaps, profiling the samplers for C++ rewrites and comparing performance with R versions.
