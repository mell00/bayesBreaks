\title{FitAR package}
\usage{
FitAR(z, p, demean = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{Numeric vector containing the observed time-series values.}

\item{p}{Positive integer giving the autoregressive order. Only scalar orders
are supported by this compatibility shim.}

\item{demean}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} the series mean is removed prior to
estimating the AR coefficients.}

\item{...}{Ignored, included for API compatibility with the retired
\code{FitAR} package.}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{'FitAR'} containing components compatible with
the original package, including the fitted coefficients, residuals, and the
Gaussian log-likelihood under the estimated innovation variance.
}
\description{
The original BAAR scripts relied on the \code{FitAR::FitAR()} function to fit
autoregressive models within each breakpoint segment. The CRAN package was
archived, so this version re-implements the subset
of functionality required by those scripts. It fits a standard
autoregressive model of the requested order using Yule-Walker equations and
returns an object that mimics the structure of the historical FitAR output.

\examples{
FitAR(stats::arima.sim(model = list(ar = 0.5), n = 100), 1)
