\arguments{
\item{k}{Optional numeric vector of initial breakpoint locations.}

\item{time}{Numeric vector of time indices for the observations.}

\item{data}{Numeric vector containing the observed time-series values.}

\item{iterations}{Number of Metropolis-Hastings samples to draw.}

\item{burn_in}{Number of iterations used for burn-in before sampling.}

\item{make_murder_p}{Proportion of steps allocated to adding or removing
breakpoints.}

\item{percent}{Width of the jiggle neighbourhood as a proportion of the
series length.}

\item{lambda}{Poisson rate parameter for the breakpoint count prior.}

\item{jump_p}{Proportion of move steps that use jump proposals rather than
jiggle proposals.}

\item{ar}{Desired order of the autoregressive model fit to each segment.}

\item{progress}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} progress bars are displayed for the
burn-in and sampling phases.}

\item{fit_storage}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} beta and sigma draws are stored.}
}
\value{
A list containing acceptance statistics, information criteria, and
sampled breakpoint sets.
}
\description{
Implements the Metropolis-Hastings sampler for the Bayesian Adaptive
Auto-Regression (BAAR) model. The algorithm searches over candidate
breakpoint configurations for autoregressive time series and returns the
accepted breakpoint sets along with model diagnostics.
