\title{Bai-Perron breakpoint search for autoregressive segments}
\usage{
bai_perron_ar(
  data,
  order = 1L,
  interval = 0.15,
  max_breaks = 3L,
  progress = interactive()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Numeric vector containing the observed time-series values.}

\item{order}{Non-negative integer giving the autoregressive order to fit in
each segment.}

\item{interval}{Minimum proportion of observations that must fall inside any
segment.  This mirrors the original Bai-Perron \code{epsilon} constraint and
prevents degenerate breakpoint placement.}

\item{max_breaks}{Maximum number of breakpoints to consider.}

\item{progress}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} a text progress bar summarises the
pre-computation of segment residual sums of squares.}
}
\value{
A list containing
\describe{
\item{breakpoints}{The breakpoint locations (indices) for the model with
the smallest BIC.  An empty integer vector indicates that the null model
with zero breaks was preferred.}
\item{all_breakpoints}{A list where the \code{k}-th element stores the
breakpoint locations associated with the optimal \code{k}-break model.}
\item{SSR}{A named numeric vector giving the residual sum of squares for
the optimal configuration with \code{k} breakpoints, including the \code{0}
breakpoint null model.}
\item{BIC}{A named numeric vector giving the Bayesian information
criterion for each breakpoint count.}
}
}
\description{
This helper mirrors the classical Bai-Perron dynamic-programming routine
that shipped with the REU BAAR scripts.  It evaluates all admissible
segmentations of an autoregressive time series up to a supplied maximum
number of breakpoints, fits an AR model within each segment using the
lightweight \code{\link[=FitAR]{FitAR()}}, and selects the configuration that minimises
the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).
